# Scheduling
Step 1: First, take the passenger flow of the first period as the origin, and calculate the remaining time and its corresponding slope  
Step 2: Calculate the number of shifts for each period based on the slope and the number of departures  
Step 3: Calculate the departure interval for each period based on the number of shifts  
Step 4: Judge the rationality of the departure interval based on the given operating time period. If it is unreasonable, return to Step 3, otherwise return to Step 5  
Step 5: Output the departure schedule
